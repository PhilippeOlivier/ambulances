# Instances for the paper "Fairness over Time in Dynamic Resource Allocation with an Application in Healthcare". 

Each instance contains two files: INSTANCE.gpickle and INSTANCE.bases.

- The gpickle file is a NetworkX graph, which can be read with that library using the `read_gpickle` function.
- the bases file is a plaintext list of vertex names of the above graph which are bases for that instance.
